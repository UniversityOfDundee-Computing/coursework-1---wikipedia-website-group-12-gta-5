                coincidentally got him fired. He helps the once-successful bank robber, and the two form a strange
                but close father-son relationship. When they execute a jewelry store heist, they are joined by
                Michael's ex-partner Trevor Philips. Are they able to put their differences aside temporarily to
                pull off a final heist.
