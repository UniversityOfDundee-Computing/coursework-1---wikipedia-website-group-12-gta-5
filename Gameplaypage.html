                    Grand Theft Auto V is an action-adventure game played from either
                    a third-person or first-person perspective. Players complete
                    missions—linear scenarios with set objectives—to progress through
                    the story. Outside of the missions, players may freely roam the
                    open world. Composed of the San Andreas open countryside area,
                    including the fictional Blaine County, and the fictional city
                    of Los Santos, the world is much larger in area than earlier
                    entries in the series. It may be fully explored after the game's
                    beginning without restriction, although story progress unlocks more
                    gameplay content.
                    The player character crouched behind a vehicle while in combat.
                    The head-up display elements are visible on-screen.
                    Players can take cover behind objects during firefights
                    to avoid taking damage from enemies.
                    Players use melee attacks, firearms and explosives to fight
                    enemies, and may run, jump, swim or use vehicles to navigate
                    the world. To accommodate the map's size, the game introduces
                    vehicle types absent in its predecessor Grand Theft Auto IV,
                    such as fixed-wing aircraft. In combat, auto-aim and a cover
                    system may be used as assistance against enemies. Should players
                    take damage, their health meter will gradually regenerate to
                    its halfway point. Players respawn at hospitals when their
                    health depletes. If players commit crimes, law enforcement
                    agencies may respond as indicated by a "wanted" meter in the
                    head-up display (HUD). Stars displayed on the meter indicate
                    the current wanted level (for example, at the maximum five-star
                    level, police helicopters and SWAT teams swarm to lethally
                    dispatch players). Law enforcement officers will search for players
                    who leave the wanted vicinity. The meter enters a cool-down mode
                    and eventually recedes when players are hidden from the officers'
                    line of sight that displays on the mini-map for a period of time.

                    The single-player mode lets players control three characters: Michael De Santa,
                    Trevor Philips and Franklin Clinton—criminals whose stories interconnect as
                    they complete missions. Some missions are completed with only one character
                    and others feature two or three. Outside the missions, players may switch
                    between characters at will by a directional compass on the HUD, although
                    this feature becomes restricted at various points throughout the story.
                    The game may switch characters automatically during missions to complete
                    specific objectives. A character's compass avatar will flash red if he
                    is in danger and needs help, and flash white if he has a strategic advantage.
                    Though players complete missions as any of the three protagonists, the more
                    difficult heist missions require aid from AI-controlled accomplices with
                    unique skill sets like computer hacking and driving. If an accomplice
                    survives a successful heist, they take a cut from the cash reward and
                    may be available for later missions with improvements to their unique
                    skills. Some heists afford multiple strategies; in a holdup mission,
                    players may either stealthily subdue civilians with an incapacitating
                    agent or conspicuously storm the venue with guns drawn.

                    Each character has a set of eight skills that represent their ability
                    in specific areas such as shooting and driving. Though skills improve
                    through play, each character has a skill with expertise by default
                    (e.g. Trevor's flying skill). The eighth "special" skill determines
                    the effectiveness in performing an ability that is unique to each
                    respective character. Michael enters bullet time in combat, Franklin
                    slows down time while driving, and Trevor deals twice as much damage
                    to enemies while taking half as much in combat. A meter on each
                    character's HUD depletes when an ability is being used and regenerates
                    when players perform skilful actions (for example, drifting in vehicles
                    as Franklin or performing headshots as Michael).
                    While free-roaming the game world, players may engage in context-specific
                    activities such as scuba diving and BASE jumping, and visit businesses
                    such as cinemas and strip clubs. Each character has a smartphone for
                    contacting friends, starting activities and accessing an in-game Internet.
                    The Internet lets players trade in stocks via a stock market. Players may
                    purchase properties such as garages and businesses, upgrade the weapons
                    and vehicles in each character's arsenal, and customise their appearance
                    by purchasing outfits, haircuts and tattoos.
