                    Grand Theft Auto V is an action-adventure game played from either
                     a third-person or first-person perspective. Players complete 
                     missions—linear scenarios with set objectives—to progress through
                      the story. Outside of the missions, players may freely roam the 
                      open world. Composed of the San Andreas open countryside area, 
                      including the fictional Blaine County,  and the fictional city
                       of Los Santos, the world is much larger in area than earlier 
                       entries in the series. It may be fully explored after the game's 
                       beginning without restriction, although story progress unlocks more
                        gameplay content.

                    The player character crouched behind a vehicle while in combat.
                     The head-up display elements are visible on-screen.
                    Players can take cover behind objects during firefights 
                    to avoid taking damage from enemies.
                    Players use melee attacks, firearms and explosives to fight 
                    enemies, and may run, jump, swim or use vehicles to navigate 
                    the world. To accommodate the map's size, the game introduces
                     vehicle types absent in its predecessor Grand Theft Auto IV, 
                     such as fixed-wing aircraft. In combat, auto-aim and a cover 
                     system may be used as assistance against enemies. Should players
                      take damage, their health meter will gradually regenerate to
                     its halfway point. Players respawn at hospitals when their
                      health depletes. If players commit crimes, law enforcement 
                     agencies may respond as indicated by a "wanted" meter in the 
                       head-up display (HUD). Stars displayed on the meter indicate
                      the current wanted level (for example, at the maximum five-star
                       level, police helicopters and SWAT teams swarm to lethally 
                       dispatch players). Law enforcement officers will search for players 
                       who leave the wanted vicinity. The meter enters a cool-down mode
                        and eventually recedes when players are hidden from the officers'
                         line of sight that displays on the mini-map for a period of time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The single-player mode lets players control three characters: Michael De Santa,
                     Trevor Philips and Franklin Clinton—criminals whose stories interconnect as 
                     they complete missions. Some missions are completed with only one character
                      and others feature two or three. Outside the missions, players may switch 
                      between characters at will by a directional compass on the HUD, although 
                      this feature becomes restricted at various points throughout the story. 
                      The game may switch characters automatically during missions to complete
                       specific objectives. A character's compass avatar will flash red if he 
                       is in danger and needs help, and flash white if he has a strategic advantage. 
                       Though players complete missions as any of the three protagonists, the more
                        difficult heist missions require aid from AI-controlled accomplices with 
                        unique skill sets like computer hacking and driving. If an accomplice 
                        survives a successful heist, they take a cut from the cash reward and
                         may be available for later missions with improvements to their unique
                          skills. Some heists afford multiple strategies; in a holdup mission,
                           players may either stealthily subdue civilians with an incapacitating
                            agent or conspicuously storm the venue with guns drawn.

                      Each character has a set of eight skills that represent their ability
                       in specific areas such as shooting and driving. Though skills improve
                        through play, each character has a skill with expertise by default 
                        (e.g. Trevor's flying skill). The eighth "special" skill determines
                         the effectiveness in performing an ability that is unique to each 
                         respective character. Michael enters bullet time in combat, Franklin
                          slows down time while driving, and Trevor deals twice as much damage
                           to enemies while taking half as much in combat. A meter on each 
                           character's HUD depletes when an ability is being used and regenerates
                            when players perform skilful actions (for example, drifting in vehicles
                             as Franklin or performing headshots as Michael).
                             While free-roaming the game world, players may engage in context-specific
                              activities such as scuba diving and BASE jumping, and visit businesses
                               such as cinemas and strip clubs. Each character has a smartphone for
                                contacting friends, starting activities and accessing an in-game Internet.
                                 The Internet lets players trade in stocks via a stock market. Players may 
                                 purchase properties such as garages and businesses, upgrade the weapons
                                  and vehicles in each character's arsenal, and customise their appearance
                                   by purchasing outfits, haircuts and tattoos.
