          Grand Theft Auto V is an action-adventure game played from either
          a third-person or first-person perspective. Players complete
          missions—linear scenarios with set objectives—to progress through
          the story. Outside of the missions, players may freely roam the
          open world. Composed of the San Andreas open countryside area,
          including the fictional Blaine County, and the fictional city
          of Los Santos, the world is much larger in area than earlier
          entries in the series. It may be fully explored after the game's
          beginning without restriction, although story progress unlocks more
          gameplay content.
          The player character crouched behind a vehicle while in combat.
          The head-up display elements are visible on-screen.
          Players can take cover behind objects during firefights
          to avoid taking damage from enemies.
          Players use melee attacks, firearms and explosives to fight
          enemies, and may run, jump, swim or use vehicles to navigate
          the world. To accommodate the map's size, the game introduces
          vehicle types absent in its predecessor Grand Theft Auto IV,
          such as fixed-wing aircraft. In combat, auto-aim and a cover
          system may be used as assistance against enemies. Should players
          take damage, their health meter will gradually regenerate to
          its halfway point. Players respawn at hospitals when their
          health depletes. If players commit crimes, law enforcement
          agencies may respond as indicated by a "wanted" meter in the
          head-up display (HUD). Stars displayed on the meter indicate
          the current wanted level (for example, at the maximum five-star
          level, police helicopters and SWAT teams swarm to lethally
          dispatch players). Law enforcement officers will search for players
          who leave the wanted vicinity. The meter enters a cool-down mode
          and eventually recedes when players are hidden from the officers'
          line of sight that displays on the mini-map for a period of time.
          The single-player mode lets players control three characters: Michael De Santa,
          Trevor Philips and Franklin Clinton—criminals whose stories interconnect as
          they complete missions. Some missions are completed with only one character
          and others feature two or three. Outside the missions, players may switch
          between characters at will by a directional compass on the HUD, although
          this feature becomes restricted at various points throughout the story.
          The game may switch characters automatically during missions to complete
          specific objectives. A character's compass avatar will flash red if he
          is in danger and needs help, and flash white if he has a strategic advantage.
          Though players complete missions as any of the three protagonists, the more
          difficult heist missions require aid from AI-controlled accomplices with
          unique skill sets like computer hacking and driving. If an accomplice
          survives a successful heist, they take a cut from the cash reward and
          may be available for later missions with improvements to their unique
          skills. Some heists afford multiple strategies; in a holdup mission,
          players may either stealthily subdue civilians with an incapacitating
          agent or conspicuously storm the venue with guns drawn.
          Each character has a set of eight skills that represent their ability
          in specific areas such as shooting and driving. Though skills improve
          through play, each character has a skill with expertise by default
          (e.g. Trevor's flying skill). The eighth "special" skill determines
          the effectiveness in performing an ability that is unique to each
          respective character. Michael enters bullet time in combat, Franklin
          slows down time while driving, and Trevor deals twice as much damage
          to enemies while taking half as much in combat. A meter on each
          character's HUD depletes when an ability is being used and regenerates
          when players perform skilful actions (for example, drifting in vehicles
          as Franklin or performing headshots as Michael).
          While free-roaming the game world, players may engage in context-specific
          activities such as scuba diving and BASE jumping, and visit businesses
          such as cinemas and strip clubs. Each character has a smartphone for
          contacting friends, starting activities and accessing an in-game Internet.
          The Internet lets players trade in stocks via a stock market. Players may
          purchase properties such as garages and businesses, upgrade the weapons
          and vehicles in each character's arsenal, and customise their appearance
          by purchasing outfits, haircuts and tattoos.
