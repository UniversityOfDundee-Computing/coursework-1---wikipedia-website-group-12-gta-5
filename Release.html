            <p>Grand Theft Auto V received "universal acclaim" from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic,
                based on 50 reviews for the PlayStation 3 version and 58 reviews for the Xbox 360 version. The
                game is Metacritic's fifth-highest rated, tied with several others. Reviewers liked the multiple lead
                character formula, heist mission design and presentation,
                but some did not agree on the quality of the story and characters. IGN's Keza
                MacDonald called Grand Theft Auto V "one of the very best video games ever made", and Play
                considered it "generation-defining" and "exceptional".Edge wrote that it is a "remarkable
                achievement" in open-world design and storytelling, while The Daily Telegraph's Tom Hoggins
                declared it a "colossal feat of technical engineering".It became the second-ever western developed
                game to be awarded a perfect score from the Japanese video game magazine Famitsu.
                CNET's Jeff Bakalar felt that the game encouraged players to engage with all three characters. Edge
                found that switching players helped avoid long travel times to mission start points. Because of the
                switching mechanic, Game Informer's Matt Bertz noted that players are kept "in the thick of the action"
                during shootouts. Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell wrote that switching added a tactical element to
                shootouts as characters set up in strategic outposts would cause fewer "shooting gallery" situations
                than previous instalments. IGN's MacDonald felt the switching feature gave players more choice in
                their approach and made missions less predictable.

                Giant Bomb's Jeff Gerstmann considered the heist missions a welcome deviation from series typical
                mission structure. Eurogamer's Bramwell likened them to "blockbuster set-pieces", and
                GameSpot's Carolyn Petit cited the 1995 film Heat as a stylistic influence on their design.
                Joystiq's Xav de Matos felt creativity and methodical approaches were encouraged. Polygon's Chris
                Plante likened rapid character switching during heist missions to "film editing, with the player serving
                as editor, switching rapidly to the most interesting perspective for any moment". Computer and
                Video Games' Andy Kelly felt that overall mission design was more diverse than and lacked the escort
                errands of its predecessors.
