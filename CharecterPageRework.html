                <h2>Intro</h2>
                <p>Trevor Philips is a character in the Grand Theft Auto series, appearing as one of the three protagonists of Grand Theft Auto V, along with Michael De Santa and Franklin Clinton, and appears as a main character in Grand Theft Auto Online. He is voiced by Steven Ogg.</p>
                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>Trevor Philips (born October 27, 1967) raised in Canada. (situated between the U.S. border) and spent most of his childhood there. He had behavioral issues in his childhood and when he got in trouble, Ryan decided to get him out of it. Years later, Trevor joined the Canadian Air Force in hopes of carrying out bomber missions but was unfortunately laid off because the Army therapist deemed him mentally unstable. Later, Trevor met Michael and instantly was infatuated with his ideas of theft and robbery. Together they carried out multiple small time robberies. (10/10 would fuck.)</p>
                <h2>Relationships With Other Characters</h2>
                <p>Michael - Trevor and Michael met while committing crimes in the same area. They first co-operated with one another to get rid of a security guard, although Trevor ended him by shooting a flare gun into his eye socket. Trevor and Michael grew a likeness for one another after they began to rob several banks back in the day. But somewhere in that time, both men had a falling out which led to a rift in their friendship. It was said by Danggg Houser that Michael may have needed to get away from Trevor, along with another statement that no one should spend much time with Trevor. Michael and Trevor don't get along very well. In some cases, an argument can result in a fight between Michael and Trevor.
                    Franklin - Both Franklin and Trevor had a hard time getting used to each other, as said during The Extraction, Trevor angrily insulted and mocked Franklin and Michael about how Michael was acting like a father to Franklin. But Trevor able to put his trust in Michael's judgement of Franklin, and the three men were able to make an well rounded but unconventional team. Both Michael and Franklin aren't very fond of Trevor.
                    Ron - Ron is Trevor's best buddy, and since Trevor can't have many friends for many reasons, (including the area in which both men live in), he is the closest friend beside Michael. But Ron is always paranoid and terrified to spend time with Trevor, (Ron being a paranoid conspiracy theorist). However, after the events of GTA V, Ron became bitter about Trevor as he has ”gone Vinewood” on him as of 2017.
                    Floyd - Floyd is another one of Trevor's associates. Although Floyd always dislikes Trevor, he is faithful to him out of fear. Trevor, for his part, always treated Floyd disdainfully, and turned him into his servant. However, it is implied during Hang Ten, Trevor is shown to have compassion for Floyd, and during a news report after the mission, it is revealed that Floyd was killed by his girlfriend Debra. However in the opening cutscene to Hang Ten it is implied that Trevor killed both of them. As he exits the building with blood all over his shirt. He then flees to the Vanilla Unicorn most likely so he’s not a suspect to the murders.</p>
