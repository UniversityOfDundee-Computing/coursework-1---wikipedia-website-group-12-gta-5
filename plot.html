                    In 2004, Michael Townley, Trevor Philips, and Brad Snider partake in a failed robbery in Ludendorff,
                    North
                    Yankton, resulting in Michael being presumed dead. Nine years later, Michael lives with his family
                    in
                    the
                    city of Los Santos under the alias Michael De Santa, having made a secret agreement with the Federal
                    Investigation Bureau (FIB) agent Dave Norton to stay hidden. Across town, gangster Franklin Clinton
                    works
                    for a corrupt car salesman and meets Michael while attempting to fraudulently repossess his son's
                    car.
                    The
                    two later become friends. When Michael finds his wife sleeping with her tennis coach, he and
                    Franklin
                    chase
                    the coach to a mansion, which Michael destroys in anger. The owner of the mansion, drug lord Martin
                    Madrazo,
                    demands compensation. Michael returns to a life of crime to obtain the money, enlisting Franklin as
                    an
                    accomplice. With the help of Michael's old friend Lester Crest, a disabled hacker, they rob a
                    jewellery
                    store to pay off the debt. Meanwhile, Trevor, who lives in squalor on the outskirts of Los Santos,
                    hears
                    of
                    the heist and realises it was Michael's work; Trevor had believed the FIB killed Michael in the
                    Ludendorff
                    heist. Trevor finds Michael and reunites with him, forcing Michael to reluctantly accept him back
                    into
                    his
                    life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As time goes on, the protagonists' lives spiral out of control. Michael's criminal behaviour prompts
                    his
                    family to leave him. When he later becomes a movie producer, he comes into conflict with Devin
                    Weston, a
                    billionaire venture capitalist and corporate raider, who attempts to shut down Michael's studio.
                    Michael
                    thwarts his efforts and inadvertently kills his assistant, causing Devin to vow revenge. Meanwhile,
                    Franklin
                    must rescue his friend Lamar Davis from their former friend and rival gangster Harold "Stretch"
                    Joseph,
                    who
                    attempts to kill them to prove himself to his new gang. Concurrently, Trevor tries to consolidate
                    his
                    control over various black markets in Blaine County, waging war against The Lost outlaw motorcycle
                    club,
                    Latin American street gangs, rival meth dealers, private security firm Merryweather, and triad
                    kingpin
                    Wei
                    Cheng.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having broken his agreement with Dave by committing heists again, Michael is coerced by Dave and his
                    superior, Steve Haines, to perform a series of operations alongside Franklin and Trevor to undermine
                    the
                    International Affairs Agency (IAA). Under Steve's direction and with Lester's help, they attack a
                    convoy
                    carrying funds for the IAA and steal an experimental chemical weapon from an IAA lab. As Steve comes
                    under
                    increasing scrutiny, he forces Michael and Franklin to erase evidence against him from the FIB
                    servers.
                    Michael takes the opportunity to wipe the data on his activities, destroying Steve's leverage over
                    him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After reconciling with his family, Michael starts planning his final heist with Trevor, Franklin,
                    and
                    Lester: raiding the Union Depository's gold bullion reserve. However, Trevor discovers that Brad was
                    not
                    imprisoned as he was led to believe, but killed during the Ludendorff heist and buried in the grave
                    marked
                    for Michael. Deducing that the heist was a setup and that he was supposed to be killed in Brad's
                    place,
                    Trevor feels betrayed and leaves Michael for dead following a standoff with Cheng's henchmen.
                    Although
                    Franklin rescues Michael, Trevor's anger towards the latter causes friction within the group and
                    threatens
                    to undermine their plans. Meanwhile, Steve betrays Michael and Dave, and they become caught in a
                    Mexican
                    standoff between the FIB, the IAA, and Merryweather. Michael and Dave are rescued by Trevor, who
                    decided
                    to
                    partake in the Union Depository heist and part ways with Michael afterwards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The heist is successful, but Franklin is afterwards approached by Steve and Dave, who contend that
                    Trevor is
                    a liability, and Devin, who seeks revenge on Michael. Franklin has three options: kill Trevor, kill
                    Michael,
                    or attempt to save both in a suicide mission. Should Franklin choose to kill either Michael or
                    Trevor,
                    he
                    ceases contact with the man he spares and returns to his old life. Otherwise, the trio, aided by
                    Lamar
                    and
                    Lester, withstands an onslaught from the FIB and Merryweather before going on to kill Cheng,
                    Stretch,
                    Steve,
                    and Devin. Michael and Trevor reconcile, and the three protagonists cease working together but
                    remain
                    friends.

                <p>The game's setting is the fictional US state of San Andreas and city of Los Santos, based on Southern
                    California and Los Angeles respectively. San Andreas was first used as Grand Theft Auto: San
                    Andreas'
                    setting, which featured three cities separated by open countryside. The team thought the ambition of
                    including three cities in San Andreas was too high, as it did not emulate the cities as well as they
                    had
                    hoped.[17] Houser felt an effective portrayal of Los Angeles needs to emulate its urban sprawl, and
                    that
                    dividing the workforce between multiple cities would have detracted from capturing "what L.A. is".
