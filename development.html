            <h2>Story Development</h2>
            <p>Rockstar North began to develop Grand Theft Auto V in 2008, around Grand Theft Auto IV's release.
                Development was conducted by a team of more than 1,000 people, including Rockstar North's core team and
                staff from parent company Rockstar Games' studios around the world.
                The proprietary Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE) was overhauled for the game to improve its draw
                distance rendering capabilities.
                The Euphoria and Bullet software handle additional animation and rendering tasks.
                Having become familiar with the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 hardware over time, Rockstar found they were
                able to push the consoles' graphical capabilities further than in previous games.
                Analyst estimations place the game's combined development and marketing budget at more than Â£170 million
                (US$265 million), which would make it the most expensive game ever made at that time.
                The open world was modelled on Southern California and Los Angeles, and its design and in-game render
                constituted much of the game's early work.
                Key members of the game world production team took field research trips throughout the region and
                documented their research with photo and video footage.
                Google Maps projections of Los Angeles were used by the team to help design Los Santos' road networks.
                To reflect and reproduce Los Angeles' demographic spread, the developers studied census data and watched
                documentaries about the city.
                A fundamental design goal from the outset was to innovate on the series core structure by giving players
                control of three lead protagonists instead of one.
                The idea was first raised during Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas' development, but contemporaneous
                hardware restrictions made it infeasible.
                Having developed two Grand Theft Auto IV episodic expansion packs featuring new protagonists in 2009,
                the team wanted to base Grand Theft Auto V around three simultaneously controlled protagonists.
                The team viewed it as a spiritual successor to many of their previous games (such as Grand Theft Auto
                IV, Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3), and designed it to improve upon their gameplay mechanics.
                They sought to improve the action gameplay by refining the shooting mechanics and cover system and
                reworked the driving mechanics to correct Grand Theft Auto IV's awkward vehicle controls.
                After an audition process, Ned Luke, Shawn Fonteno and Steven Ogg were selected to portray Michael,
                Franklin and Trevor, respectively.

            <h2>GTA Online</h2>
            <p>
                Developed in tandem with the single-player mode, the online multiplayer mode Grand Theft Auto Online was
                conceived as a separate experience to be played in a continually evolving world.
                Up to 30 players freely roam across the game world and enter lobbies to complete jobs (story-driven
                competitive and cooperative modes).
                The Content Creator toolset lets players create their own parameters for custom jobs, like racetracks
                and deathmatch weapon spawn points.
                Players may band together in organised player teams called crews to complete jobs together.
                Rockstar Games Social Club extends crews formed in Max Payne 3's multiplayer mode to those of Grand
                Theft Auto Online.
                Players may create their own crews and join up to five total.
                Crews win multiplayer matches to earn experience points and climb online leaderboards.
            
                Grand Theft Auto Online launched on 1 October 2013, two weeks after Grand Theft Auto V's release.
                Many players reported connection difficulties and game freezes during load screens.Rockstar released a
                technical patch on 5 October in an effort to resolve the issues, but problems persisted the second week
                following launch as some players reported their character progress as having disappeared.
                Another technical patch was released on 10 October combating the issues, and Rockstar offered a
                GTA$500,000 (in-game currency) stimulus to the accounts of all players connected to Online since launch
                as recompense.
                Because of the widespread technical issues present at launch, many reviewers bemoaned their Grand Theft
                Auto Online experience but generally recognised its open-ended exploration and dynamic content as
                strengths.
            
                Post-release content is continually added to Grand Theft Auto Online through free title updates.
                Some updates add new game modes and features, and others feature themed gameplay content, such as the
                Independence Day Special update that added patriotic-themed content on 1 July 2014.
                The widely anticipated Online Heists update launched on 10 March 2015 and suffered some initial
                technical difficulties due to the increased user load.
                Shortly after the game's PC release, some players reported being banned from Grand Theft Auto Online for
                using field of view and cosmetic mods in single-player.
                Rockstar stated in their official blog that nobody had been banned from Online for using single-player
                mods, but that recent updates to the PC version had the "unintentional effect" of making such mods
                unplayable.
