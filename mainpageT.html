                Grand Theft Auto V is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar
                Games.
                It
                is the seventh main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series, following 2008's Grand Theft Auto IV, and the
                fifteenth
                instalment overall. Set within the fictional state of San Andreas, based on Southern California, the
                single-player
                story follows three protagonists—retired bank robber Michael De Santa, street gangster Franklin Clinton,
                and
                drug
                dealer and gunrunner Trevor Philips—and their attempts to commit heists while under pressure from a
                corrupt
                government agency and powerful criminals. The open world design lets players freely roam San Andreas'
                open
                countryside and the fictional city of Los Santos, based on Los Angeles.
            </p>
            <p>
                The game is played from either a third-person or first-person perspective, and its world is navigated on
                foot
                and
                by vehicle. Players control the three lead protagonists throughout single-player and switch among them,
                both
                during and outside missions. The story is centred on the heist sequences, and many missions involve
                shooting and
                driving gameplay. A "wanted" system governs the aggression of law enforcement response to players who
                commit
                crimes. Grand Theft Auto Online, the game's online multiplayer mode, lets up to 30 players engage in a
                variety
                of
                different cooperative and competitive game modes.
            </p>
            <p>The game's development began around the time of Grand Theft Auto IV's release and was shared between many
                of
                Rockstar's studios worldwide. The development team drew influence from many of their previous projects
                such as
                Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3 and designed the game around three lead protagonists to innovate on
                the core
                structure of its predecessors. Much of the development work constituted the open world's creation, and
                several
                team members conducted field research around California to capture footage for the design team. The
                game's
                soundtrack features an original score composed by a team of producers who collaborated over several
                years. It
                was released in September 2013 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, in November 2014 for the PlayStation
                4 and
                Xbox One, in April 2015 for Windows, and in March 2022 for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.
            </p>

                Extensively marketed and widely anticipated, the game broke industry sales records and became the
                fastest-selling entertainment product in history, earning $800 million in its first day and $1 billion
                in its
                first three days. It received critical acclaim, with praise directed at its multiple protagonist design,
                open
                world, presentation and gameplay. However, it caused controversies related to its depiction of violence
                and
                women. It won year-end accolades including Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications, and
                is
                considered one of seventh and eighth generation console gaming's most significant titles and among the
                best
                video games ever made. It is the second best-selling video game of all time with over 169 million copies
                shipped, and as of April 2018, one of the most financially successful entertainment products of all
                time, with
                about $6 billion in worldwide revenue. Its successor is in development.
